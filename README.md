# BSIT-2A--CASE-STUDY-Complaint-or-Issue-Reporting-System---Castillo-Del-Rosario-Peralta

The Complaint or Issue Reporting System was made to provide an easy and
organized way for users to report complaints. 

The system helps both the users
and the administrator to communicate better, making sure that every issue is
handled properly. 

The system was built using JSON to store data and JavaScript
to handle interactive features.

In this project the developers are more focused on
how front-end web technologies can simulate basic database operations.


This project aims to show how front-end web technologies can perform simple
database tasks and it includes several features such as a login feature, complaint
filing module, reference number generator, complaints management, search
engine, edit feature, remarks & status update feature, and a logout feature.
These allow users to add, view, edit, and delete data—without using a traditional
server-side language. 

This method is useful for learning basic web programming
and for creating small systems that do not need complex databases.
